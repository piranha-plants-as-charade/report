\section{System Overview}

Given an input melody in the form of a digital signal, we developed a music generation algorithm that transforms the input with the following process: 1) it extracts the melodic information from the input; 2) it generates a chord progression that fits under both the extracted melody and the appropriate stylistic conventions; 3) it generates a musical accompaniment based on the melody and chord progression; and 4) it exports the generated accompaniment as a WAV file (see Figure \ref{fig:architecture}).
