        The premise of this project is to transform an input melody into a full-fledged song in the style of the song ``Piranha Plants on Parade'' from the video game ``Super Mario Bros. Wonder''. Our music generation algorithm follows the following process: 1) extract the melodic information from an input melody; 2) generate chords that fit with both the extracted melody and the stylistic conventions of ``Piranha Plants on Parade''; 3) generate the musical accompaniment based on the melody and chord progression; and 4) export the musical accompaniment as a WAV file. We were able to achieve cool results B).
