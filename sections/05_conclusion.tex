\section{Conclusion}

To summarize, we have presented Piranha Plants as Charade, a system that generates a fully harmonized song from a single melody. Our approach is based on the observation that melodies and harmonies are often closely related, and there are a limited number of ways to change between chords within the ``Piranha Plants on Parade'' style. We have demonstrated a proof of concept through Piranha Plants on Charade, solving a simplified version of the problem using hidden Markov models, digital signal processing, and more. We have also discussed several avenues for future work, including relaxing the assumptions made in our proof-of-concept implementation, improving melody extraction, and expanding to additional styles. Overall, we believe that our system is an interesting exploration of music generation, especially with the application of a hidden Markov model, and we look forward to continuing to explore its potential.
