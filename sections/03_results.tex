\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our implementation of Piranha Plants as Charade can successfully take an audio file of the melody as input and generate an audio file of the song in the style of ``Piranha Plants on Parade''. The generated output contains the melody and a harmony line sung by synthesized vocals, as well as accompanying piano and percussion parts. A collection of sample inputs and outputs is available in our public results repository at \href{https://github.com/piranha-plants-as-charade/results/tree/ff597ce27f76daa1df1426bdfcb646833f433c2e}{github.com/piranha-plants-as-charade/results}.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
\label{sec:qualitative_analysis}

To evaluate the performance of our system, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the generated audio files. We compared the generated output to the original song, ``Piranha Plants on Parade'', and assessed the following aspects:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy of the melody}: we compared the generated melody to the original melody and assessed how well it matches the original.
    \item \textbf{Chord progression}: we assessed the generated chord progression's compatibility with the melody, as well as with the original chord progression.
\end{enumerate}

The sheet music for both the original and generated versions of ``Piranha Plants on Parade'' are included in the supplementary materials in Section \ref{sec:sheet_music}. The sheet music has been cleaned up and formatted by hand for legibility and to focus on the core aspects of the song relevant to this project. In particular, we removed irrelevant instrument parts from the original sheet music and transposed it to the key of C major to match the generated version.

    \item Talk about the melody
    \item Talk about the chord progression
\end{itemize}
