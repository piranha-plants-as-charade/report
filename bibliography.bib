  abstract  = { An extended Viterbi algorithm is presented that gives a maximum a posteriori estimation of the second-order hidden Markov process. The advantage of the second-order model and the complexity of the extended algorithm are compared with those of the original first-order one. The method used to develop the extended algorithm can also be used to extend the Viterbi algorithm further to any higher order. },
